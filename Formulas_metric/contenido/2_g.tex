\subsection{Flujo de calor del suelo $G$}

Soil heat flux is the rate of heat storage in the soil and vegetation due to conduction. General METRIC applications compute G as a ratio $G/R_n$ using an empirical equation by Bastiaanssen (2000) representing values near midday

\begin{equation}
\frac{G}{R_n} = ( T_s - 273.15 ) (0.0038 + 0.0074 \alpha ) (1-0.98 \; \text{NDVI}^4) % \qquad \text{(26)}
\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_s$ : surface temperature (K)
    \item $\alpha$ : surface albedo
\end{itemize}

G is then calculated by multiplying $G/R_n$ by $R_n$.
